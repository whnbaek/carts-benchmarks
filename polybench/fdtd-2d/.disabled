# fdtd-2d test disabled
#
# Reason: Nested arts.for inside parallel EDT not yet supported.
#
# The fdtd-2d benchmark has the following structure:
#   arts.edt<parallel> {
#     scf.for t = 0 to TMAX {      // Sequential time-stepping
#       arts.for { ... }           // Nested - NOT at top level
#       arts.for { ... }
#       arts.for { ... }
#       arts.for { ... }
#     }
#   }
#
# The ForLowering pass currently only handles arts.for at the top level
# of the parallel EDT body. Supporting nested arts.for requires:
#   1. Tracing to parallel block args (not db_alloc) for datablock access
#   2. Creating db_acquire without guid (lowers to depDbAcquire)
#   3. For reductions: wrapper EDT approach (TBD)
#
# See plan file for detailed analysis.
