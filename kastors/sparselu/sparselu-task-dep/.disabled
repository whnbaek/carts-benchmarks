Block dependencies not yet supported in CARTS.

This benchmark uses OpenMP task dependencies on block-structured data (memref arrays),
which require additional compiler support for proper dependency analysis and tracking.

Expected errors:
- "Expected arts.omp_dep for dependency 0, but got memref.cast"
- "Failed to collect task dependencies"

Status: Disabled until block dependency support is implemented.
