## Bug Fix: Verification Failure (Fixed)

**Problem:** Benchmark verification was failing with checksums differing by >100%.

**Root Cause:** Layer normalization produces values centered around 0 (normalized data). The original checksum computed `sum(x[b][h])`, which is expected to be ~0 for normalized data. Near-zero sums are highly sensitive to floating-point rounding differences between ARTS and OpenMP execution paths, causing large relative differences when using percentage-based tolerance.

**Example of the bug:**
```
ARTS checksum: -1.837266609073e-06
OMP checksum:  -6.065005436540e-06
Relative diff: ~70% (verification uses 1% tolerance)
```

**Fix:** Changed checksum computation to use sum of absolute values: `sum(|x[b][h]|)` instead of `sum(x[b][h])`. This produces a meaningful non-zero checksum (~3500 for small, ~227000 for large) that is stable across different execution paths.

**Files Modified:**
- `/opt/carts/external/carts-benchmarks/ml-kernels/layernorm/layernorm.c`
- `/opt/carts/external/carts-benchmarks/ml-kernels/batchnorm/batchnorm.c` (same fix applied)
- `/opt/carts/external/carts-benchmarks/ml-kernels/activations/activations.c` (tanh checksum fixed)

**Verification Results (after fix):**
| Benchmark   | ARTS Kernel | OMP Kernel | Speedup | Correct |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------|---------|
| layernorm   | 0.0005s     | 0.0020s    | 4.32x   | YES     |
| batchnorm   | 0.0005s     | 0.0053s    | 9.74x   | YES     |
| activations | 0.0009s     | 0.0061s    | 6.42x   | YES     |
| pooling     | 0.0003s     | 0.0024s    | 6.83x   | YES     |

**Geometric mean speedup: 6.55x**

1. **Navigate to the layernorm example directory:**

   ```bash
   cd /opt/carts/external/carts-benchmarks/ml-kernels/layernorm
   ```

2. **Build carts if any changes were made:**

   ```bash
   carts build
   ```

   If there is no array.mlir run:

   ```bash
      carts cgeist layernorm.c -DMINI_DATASET -O0 --print-debug-info -S --raise-scf-to-affine -I. -I../common -I../utilities &> layernorm_seq.mlir
      carts run layernorm_seq.mlir --collect-metadata &> layernorm_arts_metadata.mlir
      carts cgeist layernorm.c -DMINI_DATASET -O0 --print-debug-info -S -fopenmp --raise-scf-to-affine -I. -I../common -I../utilities > layernorm.mlir
   ```

3. **Run the pipeline and stop after any stage**
    Run the pipeline and stop after any stage.

   For example, lets analyze the create-dbs pipeline
    ```bash
      carts run layernorm.mlir --create-dbs &> layernorm_create-dbs.mlir
    ```

4. **Finally lets carts execute and check**
```bash
    carts execute layernorm.c -O3 
   ./layernorm_arts
```

5. **Run with carts benchmarks and check**
```bash
    carts benchmarks run ml-kernels/layernorm --trace
```
Then run with size=large
```bash
    carts benchmarks run ml-kernels/layernorm --trace --size=large
```
